# Linked list cycle

[Linked List Cycle - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Successful Code

```jsx
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function hasCycle(head) {
  let fast = head;
  let slow = head;
  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    fast = fast.next.next;
    slow = slow.next;
    if (fast === slow) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

## Complexity

**Time**: `O(n)`
**Space**: `O(1)`

## Comments

To get `0(1)` space complexity, you need to use `FastPointers` and `SlowPointers`. Essentially you have the **SlowPointer** hitting each node, and then you have the **FastPointer** going at any rate faster (every second node). Eventually, the **FastPointer** will catch up to the **SlowPointter** OR it will hit the end and you will then have a non-cyclical linked list.
